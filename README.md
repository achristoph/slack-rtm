# Slack-RTM
Angular2 Application connecting to Slack RTM

What, if anything, did you learn from doing this exercise?

• If you did it over again from scratch, what sorts of things might you want to differently, or better? 
- With additional features in mind, I would make it more modular, such as defining websocket or slack service in a separate module instead of declaring them in the root module

- The regex part would be better to be supplied on the UI component instead of as a part of route parameter so that more complex regex expression can be entered

• Where could you take this tiny app from here? What might make it more practical, or even useful?
- This app can be expanded to provide real-time analysis of current trends in particular channel or all channels based on words occurences, etc. 
Data visualization can also be added to provide additional perspectives of the Slack's channel data
